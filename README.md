### Conventions

##### 0. Namespace MUST be started with galib.
ex) galib::Chromosome, galib::GAWorld

##### 1. Inner classes that user can't use (like private) MUST use prefix '__'
##### 1-1. If inner class' name has whitespace, you have to replace it with '_'
ex)
```
class Chromosome {
    class __Inner_Data { /* ... */  }
}
```
